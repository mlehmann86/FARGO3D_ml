compiling gpu version of fargo3d on taiwania:

load modules 
 1) intel/2018_u1                   2) mpi/openmpi-3.0.0/intel2018u1   3) cuda/10.0.130

compile with 

make PARALLEL=1 GPU=1 MPICUDA=0 SETUP=mkl

SETUP should be set to your own project (see setups/ folder)

MPICUDA should be 1, but the resulting code doesn't work on the cluster.
currently consulting technical support to resolve this problem. for the
time being, use MPICUDA=0. this will give a code that perform indirect 
GPU-GPU communications via the CPU, which somewhat costs performance. 

once we fix the MPICUDA issue, we should use MPICUDA=1
